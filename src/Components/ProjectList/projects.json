The middleware encapsulates the socket io component by listening to particular actions and converting it to respective socket io commands (messages).",

This was a team effort and my first interaction with Typescript. This repo does not have the complete code as some parts lie in Infosys GitLab.",

      "description": "This project is a replica of one of the tools that I created in Infosys to save the state of the React-Redux app. The major problem I faced while developing an application for Insurance Agents was that it had a pretty bad developer experience when it came to unit testing. I had to fill in hundreds of fields to test one scenario. This hack solved the problem by saving the Redux state in Indexed DB and fetches it when required. It's particularly helpful for testing many use cases without filling in much of the data. Local storage is an ideal solution for smaller apps but the project that I was working in Infosys had huge JSON and local storage was only capable of storing 5 of those objects. Hence Indexed DB saved our day by capturing the state of the applications across reloads for testing purposes.",
